Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Objectives
-----------------

To teach fundamental concepts for understanding the behavior of inorganic species, such as carbonate and trace metals, in aquatic systems. Dominantly considers a thorough treatment of equilibrium, including acid-base, complexation, precipitation-dissolution, and reduction-oxidation reactions. There is a short introduction to chemical kinetics. A main skill you will learn is to determine the equilibrium composition of a system given its initial conditions. To help you gain an intuitive sense of the behavior of complex chemical systems, approximation techniques are emphasized.

Problem Set Policy
------------------

You are encouraged to discuss class material with your classmates. Problem sets should be your own work (this is how you learn the material).

Problem sets are due at the beginning of the class period on the day stated. Late problem sets are not accepted except under extenuating circumstances (e.g., prolonged absence due to illnessâ€¦)

Don't use calculational aids other than calculators unless otherwise indicated.

Exam Dates
----------

Take-home Mid-term - To be done during a 24-hour period after Ses #13

Final Exam - 3-hour exam during exam week
